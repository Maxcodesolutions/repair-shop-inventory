# MIME Type Error Fix for Repair Shop Inventory System

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing the following error when deployed to Netlify:

```
(index):1 Refused to execute script from 'https://repairmaniac.netlify.app/message-channel-fix.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by Netlify's redirect configuration in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This redirect rule was sending **ALL** requests (including requests for JavaScript files) to `index.html`, causing the browser to receive HTML content instead of JavaScript when trying to load `message-channel-fix.js`.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Netlify Configuration

**Before (Problematic):**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  command = ""

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

**After (Fixed):**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = ""

# Ensure JavaScript files are served with correct MIME type
[[headers]]
  for = "*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "application/javascript"
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"
```

### 2. Created _redirects File

Created a `_redirects` file that provides more granular control:

```
# Netlify redirects file
# Only redirect specific SPA routes, allowing static assets to be served directly

# Redirect SPA routes to index.html (only routes without file extensions)
/dashboard    /index.html   200
/inventory   /index.html   200
/purchases   /index.html   200
/vendors     /index.html   200
/customers   /index.html   200
/repairs     /index.html   200
/outsource   /index.html   200
/invoices    /index.html   200
/quotations  /index.html   200
/pickdrop    /index.html   200
/delivery    /index.html   200
/payments    /index.html   200
/warranties  /index.html   200
/reports     /index.html   200
/users       /index.html   200

# Note: Static assets (js, css, images) will be served directly by Netlify
# without any redirects, which fixes the MIME type error
```

### 3. Created Public Folder Structure

- Moved static assets to a `public` folder
- Updated `netlify.toml` to use `publish = "public"`
- This ensures better static asset handling

### 4. Build Script

Created `build.sh` to automate the build process:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script:
- Creates the `public` folder
- Copies all necessary files
- Ensures proper file structure for deployment

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Using the Build Script (Recommended)

1. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. Deploy the `public` folder to Netlify:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the `public` folder
   - Or use: `netlify deploy --dir=public --prod`

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Create a `public` folder
2. Copy all files to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir public
   cp *.js *.css *.html *.json *.toml _redirects public/
   ```
3. Deploy the `public` folder to Netlify

### Option 3: Direct File Upload

1. Upload the `_redirects` file to your Netlify site root
2. Ensure all JavaScript files are accessible
3. Test the application

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:

1. JavaScript files load without MIME type errors
2. SPA routing works correctly (e.g., `/dashboard` loads the dashboard)
3. Static assets are served with correct MIME types
4. No console errors related to script loading

## Files Modified

- `netlify.toml` - Updated build configuration
- `_redirects` - Created new redirect rules
- `build.sh` - Created build automation script
- `public/` - Created deployment folder structure

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Eliminates Broad Redirects**: The problematic `/*` redirect is removed
2. **Specific Route Handling**: Only SPA routes are redirected to `index.html`
3. **Static Asset Preservation**: JavaScript, CSS, and other static files are served directly
4. **Proper MIME Types**: Headers ensure correct content types for different file types
5. **Cleaner Structure**: Public folder provides better organization for deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Netlify Logs**: Look for deployment errors
2. **Verify File Structure**: Ensure all files are in the `public` folder
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh the page
4. **Check Network Tab**: Verify JavaScript files are loading with correct MIME types
5. **Test Locally**: Use `netlify dev` to test locally before deployment

## Additional Notes

- The `message-channel-fix.js` file is a utility script that helps prevent message channel errors
- This fix also improves performance by allowing proper caching of static assets
- The solution maintains SPA functionality while fixing the MIME type issue
- Future deployments should use the `build.sh` script for consistency
